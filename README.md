🩺 Blood Pressure Stage Predictor
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning based web application that predicts the stage of blood pressure (e.g., Normal, Elevated, Hypertension Stage 1/2, Hypertensive Crisis) based on user health inputs.
The application is built with Flask (backend) and a simple HTML/CSS frontend to provide an easy-to-use interface.

🚀 Features

Predicts blood pressure stage using trained ML model

User-friendly web interface built with Flask & HTML

Model trained on patient dataset (patient_data.csv)

Scalable design – more health parameters can be added later

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, pickle for model saving/loading)

Flask (for backend web server)

HTML/CSS + Jinja2 (for frontend templates)
